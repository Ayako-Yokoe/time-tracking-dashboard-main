## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot through this project. One important lesson was that fetching data returns a promise, and to use the returned data, we need to store it in the proper data type. In this case, I used async and await.

```js
let jsonData = []

// Fetch Data
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("./data.json")
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Error fetching data")
    }
    jsonData = await response.json()
    displayCards()
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
}

fetchData()
```

### Continued development

Changing the background colors and images dynamically using CSS and JavaScript was a challenge, but Iâ€™ll continue to learn and improve my understanding of the logic and coding practices for this.
